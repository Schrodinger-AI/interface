            Support your favorite team by adopting a cat under either [Team Trump] or [Team Harris]. Your adoption
            counts as a supportive &quot;Vote&quot;.

          <h4>Battle for Glory ‚öîÔ∏è</h4>
          <p>
            The team with the most &quot;Votes&quot; by the end of the countdown claims victory. Cats with the winning
            team&apos;s badges will share a $1,000 USDT reward pool, while the losing team (runner-up) will share a $500
            USDT pool.
            <br />
            For instance, if Team Trump leads in votes when the event concludes, cats with [Trump] badges will share
            $1,000, and those with [Harris] badges will share $500, and vice versa.
            <br />
